SFTP(1)                    OpenBSD Reference Manual                    SFTP(1)

NAME
     sftp - secure file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     sftp [-1Cv] [-B buffer_size] [-b batchfile] [-F ssh_config]
          [-o ssh_option] [-P sftp_server_path] [-R num_requests] [-S program]
          [-s subsystem | sftp_server] host
     sftp [[user@]host[:file [file]]]
     sftp [[user@]host[:dir[/]]]
     sftp -b batchfile [user@]host

DESCRIPTION
     sftp is an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp(1), which
     performs all operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport.  It may also
     use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compres-
     sion.  sftp connects and logs into the specified host, then enters an in-
     teractive command mode.

     The second usage format will retrieve files automatically if a non-inter-
     active authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after suc-
     cessful interactive authentication.

     The third usage format allows sftp to start in a remote directory.

     The final usage format allows for automated sessions using the -b option.
     In such cases, it is necessary to configure non-interactive authentica-
     tion to obviate the need to enter a password at connection time (see
     sshd(8) and ssh-keygen(1) for details).  The options are as follows:

     -1      Specify the use of protocol version 1.

     -B buffer_size
             Specify the size of the buffer that sftp uses when transferring
             files.  Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of
             higher memory consumption.  The default is 32768 bytes.

     -b batchfile
             Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input batchfile in-
             stead of stdin.  Since it lacks user interaction it should be
             used in conjunction with non-interactive authentication.  A
             batchfile of `-' may be used to indicate standard input.  sftp
             will abort if any of the following commands fail: get, put,
             rename, ln, rm, mkdir, chdir, ls, lchdir, chmod, chown, chgrp,
             lpwd, df, and lmkdir.  Termination on error can be suppressed on
             a command by command basis by prefixing the command with a `-'
             character (for example, -rm /tmp/blah*).

     -C      Enables compression (via ssh's -C flag).

     -F ssh_config
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh(1).
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -o ssh_option
             Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
             there is no separate sftp command-line flag.  For example, to
             specify an alternate port use: sftp -oPort=24.  For full details
             of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
             ssh_config(5).

     -P sftp_server_path
             Connect directly to a local sftp server (rather than via ssh(1)).
             This option may be useful in debugging the client and server.

     -R num_requests
             Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one time.
             Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer speed but will
             increase memory usage.  The default is 64 outstanding requests.

     -S program
             Name of the program to use for the encrypted connection.  The
             program must understand ssh(1) options.

     -s subsystem | sftp_server
             Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server on
             the remote host.  A path is useful for using sftp over protocol
             version 1, or when the remote sshd(8) does not have an sftp sub-
             system configured.

     -v      Raise logging level.  This option is also passed to ssh.

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
     Once in interactive mode, sftp understands a set of commands similar to
     those of ftp(1).  Commands are case insensitive.  Pathnames that contain
     spaces must be enclosed in quotes.  Any special characters contained
     within pathnames that are recognized by glob(3) must be escaped with
     backslashes (`\').

     bye     Quit sftp.

     cd path
             Change remote directory to path.

     chgrp grp path
             Change group of file path to grp.  path may contain glob(3) char-
             acters and may match multiple files.  grp must be a numeric GID.

     chmod mode path
             Change permissions of file path to mode.  path may contain
             glob(3) characters and may match multiple files.

     chown own path
             Change owner of file path to own.  path may contain glob(3) char-
             acters and may match multiple files.  own must be a numeric UID.

     df [-hi] [path]
             Display usage information for the filesystem holding the current
             directory (or path if specified).  If the -h flag is specified,
             the capacity information will be displayed using "human-readable"
             suffixes.  The -i flag requests display of inode information in
             addition to capacity information.  This command is only supported
             on servers that implement the ``statvfs@openssh.com'' extension.

     exit    Quit sftp.

     get [-P] remote-path [local-path]
             Retrieve the remote-path and store it on the local machine.  If
             the local path name is not specified, it is given the same name
             it has on the remote machine.  remote-path may contain glob(3)
             characters and may match multiple files.  If it does and local-
             path is specified, then local-path must specify a directory.  If
             the -P flag is specified, then full file permissions and access
             times are copied too.

     help    Display help text.

     lcd path
             Change local directory to path.

     lls [ls-options [path]]
             Display local directory listing of either path or current direc-
             tory if path is not specified.  ls-options may contain any flags
             supported by the local system's ls(1) command.  path may contain
             glob(3) characters and may match multiple files.

     lmkdir path
             Create local directory specified by path.

     ln oldpath newpath
             Create a symbolic link from oldpath to newpath.

     lpwd    Print local working directory.

     ls [-1aflnrSt] [path]
             Display a remote directory listing of either path or the current
             directory if path is not specified.  path may contain glob(3)
             characters and may match multiple files.

             The following flags are recognized and alter the behaviour of ls
             accordingly:

             -1      Produce single columnar output.

             -a      List files beginning with a dot (`.').

             -f      Do not sort the listing.  The default sort order is lexi-
                     cographical.

             -l      Display additional details including permissions and own-
                     ership information.

             -n      Produce a long listing with user and group information
                     presented numerically.

             -r      Reverse the sort order of the listing.

             -S      Sort the listing by file size.

             -t      Sort the listing by last modification time.

     lumask umask
             Set local umask to umask.

     mkdir path
             Create remote directory specified by path.

     progress
             Toggle display of progress meter.

     put [-P] local-path [remote-path]
             Upload local-path and store it on the remote machine.  If the re-
             mote path name is not specified, it is given the same name it has
             on the local machine.  local-path may contain glob(3) characters
             and may match multiple files.  If it does and remote-path is
             specified, then remote-path must specify a directory.  If the -P
             flag is specified, then the file's full permission and access
             time are copied too.

     pwd     Display remote working directory.

     quit    Quit sftp.

     rename oldpath newpath
             Rename remote file from oldpath to newpath.

     rm path
             Delete remote file specified by path.

     rmdir path
             Remove remote directory specified by path.

     symlink oldpath newpath
             Create a symbolic link from oldpath to newpath.

     version
             Display the sftp protocol version.

     ! command
             Execute command in local shell.

     !       Escape to local shell.

     ?       Synonym for help.
